# Maze Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Maze project, an exciting 3D game development journey using raycasting. The project unfolds progressively through different tasks, each adding unique features to create an immersive gaming experience.


### General

### Tasks

### 0. Walls!

#### Overview

Create a window with SDL2 and implement raycasting to draw walls.

#### Steps

1. Set up SDL2.
2. Implement raycasting for wall rendering.
3. Provide a way to change the camera angle.

#### Example

### 1. Orientation

#### Overview

Differentiate wall colors based on their orientation (NORTH/SOUTH vs. EAST/WEST).

#### Steps

1.For example, you can rotate the camera when the left,right arrows are pressed on the keyboard.
2.Or you can rotate the camera when the mouse moves, just like a FPS game !

### Example
